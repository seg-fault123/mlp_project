### Recipe Rating Prediction 
This repo is my submission for the Machine Learning Practice (MLP) Project. The task was to predict the rating of the food recipes (from 0-5) tried by the customers of an online recipe app based on their text review.
The data was obtained from here: [Rating Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/recipe-for-rating-predict-food-ratings-using-ml/)

I applied various data cleaning techniques and exploratory data analysis to prepare the data for classification task.
For classification I tested and tuned various models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forrest, Bagging etc. The best performing model was SVM and Random Forrest with accuracy of 79%.

The code for all tasks and visualizations are available in the `level1.ipynb` file.
